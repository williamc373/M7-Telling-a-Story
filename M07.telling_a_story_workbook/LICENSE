This project uses 3 licenses:

1. Interactive tours (GDTours) and interactive practices (GDPractices) are All Rights Reserved.
2. The rest of the game's source code (script files, scene files, shaders, and generally all Godot-generated resources) is available under the MIT license.
3. Art assets (image textures and 3D models) are [CC-By 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

In short, this means you can reuse code and art assets in your own projects freely (other than interactive tours and auto-tested practices), including commercial ones, as long as you give credit to GDQuest. For assets, you can add this to your credits: "Additional assets CC-By 4.0 GDQuest (https://www.gdquest.com/)".

The above is just for clarity. You can find the exact terms of each license below.

## All Rights Reserved (Interactive Tours and Practices)

All interactive tours (files that use our GDTour technology to implement an interactive tour - generally but not exclusively located in a folder named "tours/") and interactive practices (files that use our GDPractice technology to implement interactive practices - generally but not exclusively located in folders named "practices/" or "practice_solutions/" folders) are the property of GDQuest and are not to be shared, copied, or redistributed without explicit permission. These materials are intended for personal use only as part of the learning experience provided by GDQuest.

For the purpose of this license, "sharing" means providing access to these files to any other person, whether directly or indirectly, for free or for a fee, uploading the content to any platform or service accessible by others, or enabling others to access the content through any means.
